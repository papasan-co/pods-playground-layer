00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.849
We are all familiar with the challenges facing York

1
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:06.079
Road and in particular York Road's business community.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.110
Blight,

3
00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:08.439
vacant properties,

4
00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.250
and absentee landlords who care only about profit rather

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.640
than leasing to tenants that would benefit the community.

6
00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.840
Too many landlords along the quarter live outside of it,

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.200
some even outside of Baltimore or Maryland.

8
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.680
We are not in need of another smoke shop,

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.409
liquor store,

10
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.290
or Dollar Tree.

11
00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.420
We deserve better,

12
00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.760
and that is where Invest York Road comes in.

13
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.250
In our model,

14
00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.529
there are no absentee landlords.

15
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.099
Rather,

16
00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.639
the community act as stewards for the properties ensuring that

17
00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.159
more small businesses,

18
00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.009
ones run by our neighbors,

19
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.009
ones tailored to our needs and desires,

20
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.240
are able to open up.

21
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.270
Together,

22
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.720
we can add to the excellent community of businesses that already exist on York Road.

23
00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.639
Together,

24
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.409
we can repair and repurpose vacant buildings and end blight.

25
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:54.319
Together,

26
00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:57.040
we can truly make York Road yours.
